Material Design Template for DevFest 2015 Season

Demo you can find here: http://vg.am/devfest

## Quick-start guide
1.  [Fork](https://github.com/gdg-x/hoverboard/fork) this repo and clone locally or [download](https://github.com/gdg-x/hoverboard/archive/master.zip) and extract Project Hoverboard to where you want to work.
2.  Install [Node.js](www.nodejs.org).
3.  Run `npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install` from the root of the folder.
4.  Modify template to suit your needs. You can find editable logos for the project [here](https://github.com/ozasadnyy/hoverboard-assets).


#### Requirements

Project dependencies:

- Node.js used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be 0.12.x or above.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the projects's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd hoverboard && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets and tools the hoverboard template requires to build and serve apps.
